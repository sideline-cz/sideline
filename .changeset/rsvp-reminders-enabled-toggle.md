Add explicit `rsvp_reminders_enabled` toggle to team settings and fix `daysBefore = 0` to mean "remind on the day of the event" (was silently treated as "disabled" because the cron filtered on `rsvp_reminder_days_before > 0`). With this change:

- Teams that had `rsvp_reminder_days_before = 0` expecting same-day reminders will now actually receive them at `rsvp_reminder_time` on the day of the event (and the late-RSVP and unclaimed-training reminders that depend on this same cron path will fire too).
- A new `rsvp_reminders_enabled` boolean (default `true`) is the explicit way to disable RSVP reminders. Surface in `Team Settings` as the "Enable RSVP reminders" checkbox.

Migrate-up only — defaults to `TRUE` for all existing teams.
