Sideline-managed Discord native onboarding: Welcome Screen, Server Guide, and a single mandatory "I've read the rules" prompt that grants an entry role.

Captains configure the rules channel, entry role, and onboarding language in team settings; a new bot poll-loop merges the Sideline-owned prompt into the guild's existing onboarding (preserving any captain-authored prompts) and pushes the Welcome Screen + Server Guide. A `GuildMemberUpdate` handler grants the entry role when Discord flips `pending: false`.

Adds:
- `teams.rules_channel_id`, `teams.onboarding_rules_role_id`, `teams.onboarding_rules_prompt_id`, `teams.onboarding_locale` (en/cs), `teams.onboarding_synced_at`, `teams.onboarding_sync_status` (pending/syncing/done/failed), `teams.onboarding_sync_error` (JSON `{code, detail}`)
- `bot_guilds.is_community_enabled`
- New `discord_guild_roles` table mirroring `discord_channels`, populated from `GuildCreate`/`GuildRoleCreate/Update/Delete` and `READY` backfill
- 10 new `Guild/*` RPCs: `PendingOnboardingSyncs`, `MarkOnboardingSyncDone`, `MarkOnboardingSyncFailed`, `MarkOnboardingSyncSkipped`, `RevertOnboardingSync`, `GetOnboardingRulesRoleId`, `SyncCommunityFlags`, `ListGuildRoles`, `SyncGuildRoles`, `UpsertGuildRole`, `DeleteGuildRole`
- `POST /teams/:teamId/onboarding/retry` HTTP endpoint
- New web "Onboarding" card on TeamSettingsPage with Discord-role picker, locale toggle, sync status, retry, and Community-feature warning state

Sync uses a four-state machine (`pending → syncing → done | failed`) with atomic `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` claims and conditional `MarkSyncDone` to safely tolerate captain re-saves mid-sync. The bot caches the per-guild rules role with a 60s TTL, invalidated on every successful PUT and on failures so captain reconfigurations take effect immediately. Guilds without the Discord Community feature are marked `done` with a `community_disabled` error code (no infinite re-poll); enabling Community in Discord auto-flips the team back to `pending` for re-sync.

Multi-bot coexistence: we preserve non-Sideline prompts but always set `enabled=true`, `mode=ONBOARDING_ADVANCED`, and rebuild `default_channel_ids`. A typed error classifier walks Discord's structured error tree (looking for `UNKNOWN_ROLE`/`INVALID_ROLE`/`UNKNOWN_CHANNEL`/`INVALID_CHANNEL` codes) so dead-role/dead-channel failures surface actionable copy in the captain UI rather than generic Discord error text.
